# ObjectCounter

This application takes outputs from the QUINT workflow and counts up the objects and sums the region area for certain mouse brain regions. There is not a detailed protocol for this app, but it functions quite similar to the begining of N2U whcih is another application that has a github page and protocol. Anything different has a label describing what it is or what it does. 

It is hosted at the following Shinyapps.io webpage:
